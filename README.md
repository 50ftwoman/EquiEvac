#EquiEvac



##Introduction
EquiEvac is here to help with the swift evacuation of horses and large animals during natural disasters and other emergencies. This app is intended to quickly and easily bring together large animal owners and attendants with capable volenteers who can assist in transport, medical care, and supplying necessities during difficult times.
